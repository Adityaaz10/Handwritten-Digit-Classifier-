# Full-Stack Handwritten Digit Classifier (MNIST)

Deep Learning Model Deployed in the Browser using TensorFlow.js
This repository showcases a complete machine learning project: a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained to classify handwritten digits (0-9), deployed directly to a web interface for real-time inference.

# Features:

1)Browser Deployment (TensorFlow.js): The trained CNN model is converted and deployed to run entirely client-side using JavaScript, eliminating the need for a backend server for predictions.

2)Real-time Inference: Users can draw a digit on the canvas, and the model provides an immediate classification prediction.

3)High Accuracy: The underlying model achieves a classification accuracy of $\mathbf{>98\%}$ on the MNIST test set.

4)Responsive Drawing Canvas: A custom JavaScript canvas implementation handles user input, preprocessing the drawing into a $28 \times 28$ pixel tensor suitable for the model input.

5)Core Technologies: Utilizes standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) for the interface, proving proficiency in full-stack ML application development.
